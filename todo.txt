> # Moving the spaceship
The space ship only moves left. Add the option to move the spaceship 
to the right.


># Alien movement
The aliens are stationary, make them move down the screen.


># Variables for screen 
Introduce two variables for screen width and height, e.g. 'h' and 'w'.
Convert the code to use those variables instead of the hardcoded values.


> # Prettify the start screen
Center the "Press [space] to play" text, add some images
(maybe an alien and a spaceship?), etc.


# More sounds
Play a sound effect when the aliens are killed. Make a theme song in the main menu


> # Alien health / hit points / HP
Aliens are killed by a single shot - give them more health
so it requires more than on hit to kill them.

hint: aliens already have an x-coordinate, e.g. a['x'], a so called 
      x attribute. Give them an health attribute, e.g. a['hp']


> # Scoreboard
Count points for each alien killed and display the score.


# Game over
Add a game over state so the text "GAME OVER" is displayed
on top of the game once an alien touches the bottom of the screen.

Allow the player to restart the game by pressing "[r] to retry".

hint: add another game-state called "gameover", change to that state
      once an alien touches the bottom of the screen.
